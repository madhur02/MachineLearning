# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).
For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out mdhr.jain@gmail.com

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1.	Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2.	Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

## Projects


###	Python

  *	[ML with K Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/madhur02/MachineLearning/blob/main/03%20KNN(%20K%20Nearest%20Neighbour)/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20with%20Python.ipynb): Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
  *	[ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/madhur02/MachineLearning/blob/main/04%20Decision%20Tree/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests%20in%20Python.ipynb): Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com
  *	[Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems](https://github.com/madhur02/MachineLearning/blob/main/09%20Recommender%20system/Recommender%20Systems%20with%20Python.ipynb): A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
  *	[Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/madhur02/MachineLearning/blob/main/07%20SVM%20(%20Support%20Vector%20Machine)/Support%20Vector%20Machines%20with%20Python.ipynb): Using Support vector classifier on Breast Cancer dataset for classifying the type of cancer.

###	Machine Learning
* [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/madhur02/MachineLearning/blob/main/01%20Linear%20Regression/LinearRegression%20using%20Statsmodel.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
* [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/madhur02/MachineLearning/blob/main/06%20K-Means/K%20Means%20Clustering%20with%20Python.ipynb): Creating Customer Segments: Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
*	[Ensemble Learning technique](https://github.com/madhur02/MachineLearning/blob/main/06%20K-Means/K%20Means%20Clustering%20with%20Python.ipynb): A model which will predict the loan status of a person based on various parameters. Using ensemble of various primitive machine learning model for predicting loan status.
* [Model as a Service](https://github.com/madhur02/MachineLearning/tree/main/11%20Flask): Converting Logistic regression model as a service using Flask App. 

Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
